                    About Me
                </h2>
                <h3>My name is Kevin Gallegos, a graduate from UC Santa Cruz, with a degree in Computer Science with a focus in Game Design. Since the day I could organize my thoughts I always liked the idea of being able to create stuff. 
                    I took inspiration by the world and enviroment around me and was curious on how stuff worked. I remember myself creating toys out of paper to play with and drawing comics as a medium to share my thoughts and feelings. 
                    Overtime this curiosity, the idea of creating and sharing led me to the world of computers and from there I found a medium that I could express myself in. 
                    Coming up to college I experimented with modding games and personalizing my computer, obtaining a fond intrest in everything from games to building computers. I learned invaluable skills in communication and leadership working at Summer Camps.
                    All of these intrests and skills culminating together to allow me to pursue my intrest in sharing with the world something that I can make and be interacted with using the medium of programmable media, Games.

                <p><h3>The Placement System is a complex system that handles a series of functionality between multiple scripts. Its base functionality is to handle placing furniture of various sizes
                    while compensating for said sizes and unique properties, handling rotation options and communicating with tiles that they can be placed on, all synced between players in servers.

                <p><h3>The Inventory System goes hand & hand with the Placement System that handles data such as currency, collected furniture and the UI that goes along with it. The Inventory
                    system allows users to interact with the tiles when furnishing their Cafe while syncing all data between players making sure said tile can be placed on by communicating with the 
                    placement system.

                    sequence that can have NPCs react accordingly. This also handles NPCs switching states along with their appropriate animations to compliment the main gameplay loop of our game.
